# Pharmacy Scrapper
Small app for comparing prices in biggest Polish online pharmacies. Creates a spreadsheet with the results from up to five stores.

The app has a fully functional GUI. The user can enter any desired product's name to compare the prices between the selected pharmacies. The storeâ€™s website gets scraped using the Selenium library, extracts the prices data and generates an .xlsx spreadsheet containing a list of the results.
